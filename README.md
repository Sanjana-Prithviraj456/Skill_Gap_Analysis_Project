# Skill_Gap_Analysis_Project

# 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes the gap between the skills students possess and what the job market expects. A survey was conducted among final-year students, recent graduates, and early working professionals to understand their job readiness, technical skills, certifications, confidence levels, and placement challenges.

Using Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, the data was cleaned, visualized, and interpreted to uncover key insights about the current state of employability.
